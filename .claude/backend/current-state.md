## Database Schema Status

**Collections in use:**
- `users` - Active
- `hunts` - Active
- `steps` - Defined, not used
- `assets` - Defined, not used
- `progress` - Defined, not used
- `livehunts` - Defined, not used
- `publishedhunts` - Defined, not used

## API Endpoints

**Implemented:**
```
POST   /auth/signup
POST   /auth/login
POST   /api/hunts              # Create hunt
GET    /api/hunts              # Get current user's hunts
GET    /api/hunts/:id          # Get hunt by ID
```

**Needed - High Priority (Tree VIEW API):**
```
GET    /api/hunts/:id/tree     # Get compact step list for tree visualization (PRIORITY)
GET    /api/steps/:id          # Get full step details
```

**Needed - Core CRUD:**
```
PUT    /api/hunts/:id          # Update hunt
DELETE /api/hunts/:id          # Delete hunt
POST   /api/hunts/:id/steps    # Add step
PUT    /api/steps/:id          # Update step
DELETE /api/steps/:id          # Delete step
PUT    /api/hunts/:id/step-order # Reorder steps
```

**Needed - Publishing & Playing:**
```
POST   /api/hunts/:id/publish  # Publish hunt
GET    /api/hunts/:id/live     # Get live version
GET    /api/play/:huntId       # Get live hunt for playing
POST   /api/play/:huntId/steps/:stepId/complete  # Submit step completion
GET    /api/play/:huntId/progress  # Get user progress
```

## Technical Debt / TODOs

1. **Serializers removed** - Now using mongoose toJSON() method ‚úÖ
2. **creatorId reference** - Has "TODO revert" comment in Hunt.ts:7
3. **Validation schemas** - Domain-organized structure complete ‚úÖ
4. **Type inconsistencies** - OpenAPI types vs DB types need reconciliation
5. **Error messages** - Some errors lack descriptive messages
6. **Testing** - Integration tests implemented ‚úÖ (need more test coverage)
7. **Documentation** - No API docs yet (Swagger UI installed but not configured)

## üéØ Current Priority: Tree VIEW API (2025-10-27)

**Decision made:** Implement tree VIEW (visualization with lazy loading) NOW, reserve gameplay branching for V1.1+

**See:** `.claude/tree-and-branching-strategy.md` for complete context

### Tree VIEW API Implementation (~1 week)

**Backend work:**
- [ ] Create `GET /api/hunts/:id/tree` endpoint
  - Returns compact step list (id, type, title, order)
  - No full challenge data (lazy loading pattern)
  - Performance optimized for large step counts
- [ ] Update `GET /api/hunts` to include `stepCount`
  - Add to response: `{ id, name, status, stepCount, updatedAt }`
  - Allows UI to show step count without fetching steps
- [ ] Ensure `GET /api/steps/:id` returns full step details
  - Full challenge data loaded on demand
  - When user clicks step in tree
- [ ] Add database indexes for performance
  - Index on `Step.huntId` for efficient tree queries
  - Index on `Step.order` for sorted retrieval

**API Design Pattern (Lazy Loading):**
```typescript
// 1. GET /api/hunts - Compact list
Response: {
  hunts: [
    { id: "hunt-1", name: "Barcelona", status: "draft", stepCount: 14 }
  ]
}

// 2. GET /api/hunts/:id/tree - Compact step list
Response: {
  id: "hunt-1",
  name: "Barcelona Adventure",
  steps: [
    { id: "step-1", type: "clue", title: "Find Sagrada", order: 1 },
    { id: "step-2", type: "quiz", title: "Who designed it?", order: 2 }
  ]
}

// 3. GET /api/steps/:id - Full details on click
Response: {
  id: "step-1",
  type: "clue",
  challenge: { clue: { title: "...", description: "..." } },
  hint: "...",
  requiredLocation: { lat: 41.4, lng: 2.17, radius: 50 }
}
```

**Frontend work (separate):**
- Tree component showing compact step list
- Lazy load full details on step click
- Visual tree representation in editor

**Why this matters:**
- Better editor UX (visual overview)
- Production-quality API (efficient data transfer)
- Foundation for future branching (V1.1+)
- Scalable (works with 100+ steps)

**Future (V1.1+): Gameplay Branching**
- Use existing `Step.metadata` field (no model changes needed!)
- Add branching logic to player API
- No breaking changes to current implementation

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **üî• Tree VIEW API** (~1 week) - **CURRENT PRIORITY**
   - Implement endpoints above
   - Add indexes
   - Test with large step counts

2. **Complete Hunt CRUD** (~3-4 days)
   - Update hunt (PUT /api/hunts/:id)
   - Delete hunt (DELETE /api/hunts/:id)

3. **Step Management** (~1 week)
   - Full CRUD for hunt steps
   - Add step (POST /api/hunts/:id/steps)
   - Update step (PUT /api/steps/:id)
   - Delete step (DELETE /api/steps/:id)
   - Reorder steps (PUT /api/hunts/:id/step-order)

4. **Publishing MVP** (~1-2 weeks)
   - Simplified: Draft ‚Üí Published (skip Review for MVP)
   - Publish hunt (clone hunt + steps)
   - Create PublishedHunt record
   - Create LiveHunt record

5. **Hunt Player** (~1-2 weeks)
   - Get live hunt for playing
   - Submit step completion
   - Track progress

6. **Testing** - Ongoing
   - Add integration tests for new endpoints
   - Test tree API performance

7. **API Documentation** - Lower priority
   - Configure Swagger UI
