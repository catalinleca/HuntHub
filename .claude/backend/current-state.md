## üöß Partially Implemented / Known Issues

### Hunt Features

- [ ] Challenge response handling
- [ ] Scoring/completion logic

### Data Models (Defined but Not Used)
- [ ] Step service/controller/routes
- [ ] Asset service/controller/routes (for media uploads)
- [ ] Progress service/controller/routes (tracking user progress)
- [ ] LiveHunt service (active hunt instances)
- [ ] PublishedHunt service (hunt versions)

## ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented

### Hunt Participation
- [ ] Start a hunt (create LiveHunt)
- [ ] Submit challenge responses
- [ ] Validate location proximity
- [ ] Track progress
- [ ] Complete hunt
- [ ] Leaderboards/scoring

### Location Features
- [ ] Location validation middleware
- [ ] GPS proximity checks
- [ ] Map integration

### Media/Assets
- [ ] File upload handling
- [ ] Image/video storage
- [ ] Asset CDN integration

### Hunt Discovery
- [ ] Public hunt listing
- [ ] Search/filter hunts
- [ ] Hunt categories/tags

### Social Features
- [ ] Hunt sharing
- [ ] Collaboration/permissions
- [ ] Comments/reviews

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Real-time updates (WebSockets?)
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Analytics/insights
- [ ] Admin dashboard

## Database Schema Status

**Collections in use:**
- `users` - Active
- `hunts` - Active
- `steps` - Defined, not used
- `assets` - Defined, not used
- `progress` - Defined, not used
- `livehunts` - Defined, not used
- `publishedhunts` - Defined, not used

## API Endpoints

**Implemented:**
```
POST   /auth/signup
POST   /auth/login
POST   /api/hunts              # Create hunt
GET    /api/hunts              # Get current user's hunts
GET    /api/hunts/:id          # Get hunt by ID
```

**Needed:**
```
PUT    /api/hunts/:id          # Update hunt
DELETE /api/hunts/:id          # Delete hunt
POST   /api/hunts/:id/publish  # Publish hunt
GET    /api/hunts/:id/steps    # Get steps
POST   /api/hunts/:id/steps    # Add step
...and many more
```

## Technical Debt / TODOs

1. **Serializers removed** - Now using mongoose toJSON() method
2. **creatorId reference** - Has "TODO revert" comment in Hunt.ts:7
3. **Validation schemas** - Only auth schemas exist, need hunt schemas
4. **Type inconsistencies** - OpenAPI types vs DB types need reconciliation
5. **Error messages** - Some errors lack descriptive messages
6. **Testing** - No tests written yet
7. **Documentation** - No API docs yet (Swagger UI installed but not configured)

## Next Steps (Suggested)

1. **Complete Hunt CRUD** - Update, delete, publish endpoints
2. **Step Management** - Full CRUD for hunt steps
3. **Challenge Validation** - Implement challenge-specific logic
4. **Hunt Publishing** - Workflow from draft ‚Üí published
5. **LiveHunt** - Enable users to start/participate in hunts
6. **Testing** - Add unit/integration tests
7. **API Documentation** - Configure Swagger UI
