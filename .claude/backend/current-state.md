## üöß Partially Implemented / Known Issues

- [ ] PublishedHunt service (hunt versions)

## ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented

## Database Schema Status

**Collections in use:**
- `users` - Active
- `hunts` - Active
- `steps` - Defined, not used
- `assets` - Defined, not used
- `progress` - Defined, not used
- `livehunts` - Defined, not used
- `publishedhunts` - Defined, not used

## API Endpoints

**Implemented:**
```
POST   /auth/signup
POST   /auth/login
POST   /api/hunts              # Create hunt
GET    /api/hunts              # Get current user's hunts
GET    /api/hunts/:id          # Get hunt by ID
```

**Needed:**
```
PUT    /api/hunts/:id          # Update hunt
DELETE /api/hunts/:id          # Delete hunt
POST   /api/hunts/:id/publish  # Publish hunt
GET    /api/hunts/:id/steps    # Get steps
POST   /api/hunts/:id/steps    # Add step
...and many more
```

## Technical Debt / TODOs

1. **Serializers removed** - Now using mongoose toJSON() method ‚úÖ
2. **creatorId reference** - Has "TODO revert" comment in Hunt.ts:7
3. **Validation schemas** - Domain-organized structure complete ‚úÖ
4. **Type inconsistencies** - OpenAPI types vs DB types need reconciliation
5. **Error messages** - Some errors lack descriptive messages
6. **Testing** - Integration tests implemented ‚úÖ (need more test coverage)
7. **Documentation** - No API docs yet (Swagger UI installed but not configured)

## Next Steps (Suggested)

1. **Complete Hunt CRUD** - Update, delete, publish endpoints
2. **Step Management** - Full CRUD for hunt steps
3. **Challenge Validation** - Implement challenge-specific logic
4. **Hunt Publishing** - Workflow from draft ‚Üí published
5. **LiveHunt** - Enable users to start/participate in hunts
6. **Testing** - Add unit/integration tests
7. **API Documentation** - Configure Swagger UI
