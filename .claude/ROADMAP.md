# HuntHub Development Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2025-10-28 (Week 1 COMPLETE!)

**Product vision:** Portfolio-quality treasure hunt platform with location-based challenges, built production-ready in 2 months.

**Timeline:** MVP → V1.1 → V1.2 (phased delivery)

**🎉 Week 1 Completed (2025-10-28):**
- ✅ Hunt CRUD Complete (6/6 endpoints)
- ✅ Step CRUD Complete (3/3 endpoints)
- ✅ Reorder Steps (bonus from Week 2)
- ✅ OpenAPI schema fixes (type/challengeType inconsistencies)

- Time: 2-3 hours

---

## 📊 Progress Overview

**Current Phase:** UUID Migration (Critical Architecture Fix)
**Previous Sprint:** ✅ Week 1 Complete - Hunt CRUD + Step CRUD
**Overall Progress:** ~30% to MVP completion

**Key Metrics:**
- Backend Epics: 2/6 complete (33%) - Epic 1 Complete, Epic 3 Complete
- Frontend Epics: 0/4 started (0%)
- Integration Epics: 0/2 started (0%)

**Updated Timeline:**
- ✅ Week 1: Hunt CRUD + Step CRUD (COMPLETE)
- 🔥 UUID Migration: 2-3 hours (CRITICAL - before Week 2)
- Week 2: Tree VIEW + Challenge Validation
- Week 3: Asset Management (CRITICAL - blocks Publishing)
- Week 4: Publishing Workflow
- Week 5-6: Player API

---

## 🎯 Roadmap Structure

**Hierarchy:**
- **Theme** - Major focus area (Backend, Frontend, Integrations)
- **Epic** - Large feature requiring multiple weeks
- **Story** - Specific feature (1-5 days)
- **Tasks** - Implementation details (see backend/current-state.md)

## Epic-Level Dependencies

```
Epic 1 (Hunt CRUD) ✅ Week 1
    │
    └──> Epic 3 (Step CRUD) - Week 1-2
              │
              ├──> Epic 2 (Tree VIEW) - Week 2
              │
              └──> Epic 6 (Assets) - Week 3 ⚠️ CRITICAL
                        │
                        ├──> Epic 4 (Publishing) - Week 4
                        │         │
                        │         └──> Epic 10 (Pub UI) - Week 10-11
                        │
                        └──> Epic 5 (Player API) - Week 5-6
                                  │
                                  └──> Epic 11 (Player UI) - Week 11-12

Epic 8 (Dashboard) - Week 7-8
    │
    └──> Epic 9 (Editor) - Week 8-10

Epic 12 (Stripe) - Week 12-13 (post-MVP)
Epic 7 (AI) - V1.1 (post-MVP)

Epic 13 (Deployment) - Week 13-14 (final)
```

**Key Changes from Original Plan:**
- ✅ Tree VIEW moved AFTER Step CRUD (needs steps to visualize)
- ⚠️ Assets moved from Week 6-7 to Week 3 (CRITICAL for Publishing + Player)
- ✅ Publishing now depends on Assets (can't publish missions without file upload)
- ✅ Player API already depended on Assets (correct in original plan)

## Critical Path (Longest dependency chain)

```
NOW:    Hunt CRUD → Step Create → Tree VIEW (5-6 days)
NEXT:   Step CRUD → Publishing → Player API (15-18 days)
LATER:  Dashboard → Editor → Player → Deployment (25-30 days)

Total critical path: ~50-55 days (10-11 weeks to deployable MVP)
```

## Parallel Work Opportunities

**Can work on simultaneously:**
- Hunt CRUD (BE-1.4, BE-1.5) can be done in parallel
- Tree VIEW components (BE-2.1, BE-2.2) after BE-3.1
- Step CRUD operations (BE-3.2, BE-3.3, BE-3.4) are independent
- Asset management can be built parallel to Publishing
- Frontend Dashboard can start while backend completes Player API

# 🚀 VELOCITY TRACKING

**Sprint duration:** 1 week
**Current sprint:** Week 1-2 (Oct 27 - Nov 3)

**Velocity (Story Points):**
- Week 1: 8 points (Infrastructure)
- Week 2: TBD (Current sprint)

**Story point estimates:**
- Small story (0.5-1 day): 2 points
- Medium story (2-3 days): 5 points
- Large story (4-5 days): 8 points

**Target velocity:** 10-15 points/week (realistic for solo developer)
