# CodeRabbit Configuration - Balanced Mode
# Focus on bugs, security, and meaningful patterns - not nitpicking

# CRITICAL: Before suggesting ANY code changes or library usage, you MUST verify
# the exact version we have installed and check current documentation.
# Never suggest deprecated features or outdated APIs.
#
# ZERO TOLERANCE for outdated recommendations - especially for React Hook Form,
# TanStack Query, zustand, Zod, and Material UI.
#
# Check package.json versions FIRST, then verify against current docs.
# If unsure, ask rather than suggest deprecated code.

        Focus on actual bugs and security issues:
        - SQL injection risks (string concatenation in queries)
        - Missing error handling that could crash the server
        - Authentication/authorization gaps
        - Race conditions that could corrupt data
        - Memory leaks (unclosed connections)
        - Hardcoded secrets/credentials

        - N+1 queries (performance impact)
        - Better error messages for debugging
